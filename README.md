The Waves/NEUROMASTER protocol’s smart contracts enable changing the default behaviour of accounts and assets. Using NEUROMASTER® smart contracts on Waves, you can also create a dApp — an application that is stored and executed on the blockchain network.

Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS) is an enhanced proof of stake consensus algorithm that allows you to lease your NEUROMASTER® tokens to a Waves node, earning a percentage of the node payout, as a reward.

NEUROMASTER/Waves security is guaranteed by time-proven Proof-of-Stake consensus with more than 300 nodes all over the world. Ride language is built on a tech stack designed to avoid programming mistakes potentially leading to serious errors. Interaction with blockchain-enabled applications is seamless and safe.

DApps for storing and managing your crypto assets. Independent products built on Waves and driven by the community

The major problem that oracles solve is that blockchains can only access data stored within the blockchain. Oracles provide connection with real-world data. Developers can explore existing oracles or build your own. Gravity, a decentralized cross-chain and oracle network powered by Waves.

NEUROMASTER / Waves designed to be easily swapped eg.  Crypto Currency, Fiat and Tokens including different blockchains. >> uniswap 1inch Token swap coming soon

Ride is Waves/NEUROMASTER’ functional purpose-designed smart contract language for dApp development, designed for applying scripts to assets and accounts on the Waves blockchain, as well as for creating sophisticated programmable logic for a decentralized environment.

Neutrino.protocol enables the tokenization of national currencies or commodities by algorithmically maintaining the economic stability of the synthetic asset rate.

USDN staking functionality
An estimated annual yield can range from 8% to 15%, depending on market conditions and the exchange rate of WAVES.

NSBT/NEUROMASTER Utility token for the Neutrino system designed to ensure the stability of reserves on the Neutrino smart contract.

5% of [NXR] TX Totals will be donated to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Australia. https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.au/ 

5% of [NXR] TX Totals will be used for further development of the 65Roses Token [65Roses]

- The 65 Roses Story
The “65 Roses” story dates back to 1965 when an observant 4-year-old, hearing the name of his disease for the 
first time, pronounced cystic fibrosis as "65 Roses." Today, “65 Roses” is a term often used by young children 
with cystic fibrosis to pronounce the name of their disease.

## DEX Wallet and Trading

> Waves.tech, an ecosystem of next-generation technologies built on the Waves protocol, has ported its native token WAVES into 
Ethereum to enhance interoperability between the two networks and introduce Waves functionality to Ethereum users. 

WAVES token holders will have access to numerous decentralized applications, exchanges, and DeFi protocols operating on the 
Ethereum blockchain, whose users, in turn, will gain easy access to the WAVES coin. In particular, WAVES pools will become 
available on Uniswap, Mooniswap and Curve.

The Waves-Ethereum gateway is available through the Waves.Exchange interface. In order to issue one ERC-20 WAVES, 
users have to lock one WAVES on the Waves blockchain. Converting tokens from Ethereum back to Waves is also possible.
The address of ERC-20 WAVES smart contract is 0x1cf4592ebffd730c7dc92c1bdffdfc3b9efcf29a.ADVERTISEMENT

In 2021, the gateway will be operated through Gravity, a data protocol that connects disparate blockchains with a truly 
agnostic and untokenized hub, acting as an oracle between systems. The Waves team is also going to implement the option 
of staking WAVES tokens directly from Ethereum wallets.

“Ethereum is the leading blockchain by the number of dApp users,” says Sasha Ivanov, Waves founder. “The emergence of the 
WAVES token in ERC-20 format provides new opportunities for interaction between the two ecosystems. Some tokens on the Waves 
blockchain have already been accessible in the Ethereum network for a couple of months, and we see a growing demand for them. 
This is an example of working cross-chain interoperability which has been so much discussed recently.”

Earlier this year, Waves announced the porting of two tokens into the Ethereum network — Neutrino USD (USDN), 
an algorithmic dollar-pegged stablecoin, and Neutrino System Base Token (NSBT), a system and governance token for the 
Neutrino protocol, running on the Waves blockchain. So far, about 13.7 million USDN have been transferred to 
Ethereum and are available in the pools of major DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap, 1inch and Curve.
